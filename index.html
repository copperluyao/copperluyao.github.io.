%% Surprising SVD, Square Waves, and Pi
% I am surprised when many of the singular values of a nonsymmetric
% variant of the Hilbert matrix turn out to be nearly equal to $\pi$.
% The explanation involves the Fourier series for a square wave.

%% The Nonsymmetric Hilbert Matrix
% My very first project in matrix computation involved the Hilbert matrix.
% It had been introduced in 1894 by the famous mathematician David Hilbert
% as what we would today call the coefficient matrix in the normal equations
% for least squares approximations by polynomials with their monomial basis.
% The elements of an $n$ -by- $n$ Hilbert matrix are
%
% $$ a_{i,j} = \frac{1}{i+j-1}, \ \ i,j = 1,...,n $$
%

%%
% Some years ago I wanted a nonsymmetric test matrix, so I changed the plus
% sign in the denominator to a minus sign, but those elements blew up along
% the subdiagonal, so I also changed the -1 to +1/2.
%
% $$ a_{i,j} = \frac{1}{i-j+1/2}, \ \ i,j = 1,...,n $$
%
% I refer to this as the nonsymmetric Hilbert Matrix.  Here is the 5-by-5
% with |format rat|.

   format rat
   n = 5;
   [I,J] = ndgrid(1:n);
   A = 1./(I-J+1/2)

%% Singular Values
% I was amazed I happened to compute the singular values.  Here are
% all of the singular values of the 30-by-30 nonsymmetric Hilbert matrix.

   format long
   n = 30;
   [I,J] = ndgrid(1:n);
   A = 1./(I-J+1/2);
   sigma = svd(A)

 %%
% Incredibly, half of them are equal to |pi| to the full length of our
% long format, that's 16 digits.  And all but the last few are equal to |pi|
% to at least a couple of digits.  How did that happen?


%% High Precision Calculation
% Let's do the 30-by-30 SVD again, this time using the Symbolic Toolbox
% with 100-digit arithmetic.  The computation takes about a minute and a
% half on my machine.

   tic
   digits(100)
   n = 30;
   [I,J] = ndgrid(sym(1:n));
   A = 1./(I-J+1/2);
   sigma = svd(A);
   toc 

%%
% Here is the first singular value, to 100 digits.

   sigma1 = sigma(1)

%%
% Here is a logarithmic plot of the difference between the singular values
% and $\pi$.

   semilogy(abs(pi - sigma),'.')
   xlabel('n')
   ylabel('|\pi - \sigma|');

%%
% The first singular value equals $\pi$ to 44 digits and, as our double
% precision computation predicted, fifteen of the thirty singular values
% equal $\pi$ to at least 15 digits.

%% Seymour Parter
% Seymour Parter was a visiting professor at Stanford when I was a grad
% student there in the early 1960s.  I took an individual reading course
% under his supervision.  He went from Stanford to the University of Wisconsin,
% where he spent the rest of his career as a Professor of Mathematics and
% Computer Sciences.  He was President of SIAM in 1981 and '82.

%%
% In 1985, the Second SIAM Conference on Linear Algebra was held at North
% Carolina State University in Raleigh.  I demonstrated MATLAB during the
% coffee breaks.  We didn't really have a booth, just a desk or table. 
% I used this example in my demonstration and asked conference attendees
% if they could explain the appearance of $\pi$.  Seymour said that he could.
% He had written two papers twenty years earlier about eigenvalues of Toeplitz
% matrices that were relevant.  He soon produced another paper, referenced
% below, that explains the behavior of the singular values of my nonsymmetric
% Hilbert matrix.  It is related to a result from 1920 by the famous Hungarian
% mathematician Gabor Szego.

%% Toeplitz Matrices
% Our matrix $A$ is constant along its diagonals, so it is a Toeplitz matrix.
% So is the $2n$ -by- $2n$ matrix $B$ constructed from $A$ by the MATLAB
% array operation
%
%  Z = zeros(size(A)); 
%  B = -i*[Z A; -A' 0];
%
% The matrix $B$ is both Hermitian and Toeplitz.  Its eigenvalues are real
% and occur in plus/minus pairs.  The absolute values of the eigenvalues
% of $B$ are the singular values of $A$, each repeated twice.

%%
% Szego's 1920 theorem says that the eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix
% formed from the coefficients in the Fourier expansion of a function converge
% to the max and min of that function.

%%
% Parter realized two important facts.  First, that he could analyze the
% singular values of my nonsymmetric matrix $A$ by looking at the eigenvalues
% of the Hermitian matrix $B$.  And second, that the elements of $A$ and
% $B$ are the reciprocals of odd integers, which are the coefficients of
% the Fourier expansion of a square wave.  So Szego's 1920 theorem implies
% that the largest eigenvalues of $B$ and hence the largest singular values
% of $A$ converge to the maximum of that square wave.

%% Square Wave
% There is already a hint of what is going on in an old MATLAB demo named
% |xfourier|.  The first line of |xfourier| says
%
% <html>
% <p style="margin-left:3ex;">
% This example shows (graphically) how the Fourier series expansion for
% a square wave is made up of a sum of odd harmonics.
% </p>
% </html>

%%
% The core of |xfourier| is a code fragment similar to this.

sin
%%

%%
% The plot shows two things.  First you notice the overshoot at the ends of
% the intervals known as the Gibbs phenomenon.  But more important for our
% purposes here is the convergence in the interior of the intervals to values
% near plus and minus 0.8.

%%
% Let's use more terms and take a closer look.
% 
% %    t = -pi:pi/256:pi; y = zeros(size(t)); for k = 1:2:599
% %       y = y + sin(k*t)/k;
% %    end plot(t,y) axis([0 pi .76 .81])

%%
% We find the sum is pointwise converging to a value near 0.7854.
% The fragment code is approximating the Fourier sine expansion
%
% $$ s(t) = \sum_{odd\ k}\frac{\sin{kt}}{k} $$
%
% The coefficients are the reciprocals of odd integers, which are the same
% as the elements of the nonsymmetric Hilbert matrix.

%%
% The Fourier series converges pointwise to $\pm\pi/4$.
% If we trace this fact back through  Parter's analysis and Szego's theorem,
% we have an explanation for the fact that the largest singular values of the
% nonsymmetric Hilbert matrix are converging to $\pi$.

% In 1991 he studied the behavior of the small singular values of this matrix.
% And in 1992 he considered the matrices where the 1/2 is replaced by any
